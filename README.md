# stockpullbot
Discord bot that pulls a stock price according to the a user-entered ticker.

Built on Python. First Python project using API integration.

This project uses Discord and yfinance APIs. Based on the submitted ticker, the stock information (most recent market price) is pulled from the ticker profile and then returned to the user.

Future Improvements:
- Ability for users to pull other types of data (ex. over a time range)
- Displaying a message/suggestions for incorrectly spelled tickers
